- 😄 Pronouns: I am a man driven by the sound of music. I participated in the Kenya National Music Festival in the year 2023.I also played rugby but due to minor injuries I had to step down focus on my studies, it will be a pleasure given the same opportunity to rise Zetech`s flag up high in Co-curriculum and curriculum.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am simple and understanding. Highly respect women and “Did you know? Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible!”
